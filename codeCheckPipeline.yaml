# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# trigger:
# - main
# - pull_request

pool: CloudVM

steps:
- script: echo Hello, world!
- script: echo $(Build.SourceVersion)
- script: echo $(githubPat)
  displayName: 'Run a one-line script'
  
# - task: UiPathRunJob@3
#   inputs:
#     orchestratorConnection: 'UiPath Test Connection'
#     processName: 'vajrang_logtime'
#     folderName: 'Shared'
- task: CmdLine@2
